 <h3> ~~ To boost brain power, eat a piece of dark chocolate or two for a fun way of improving your diet! </h3>
 <h3> ~~ If you are feeling extra stressed, stop what you are doing, print out some adult coloring pages and just color to calm yourself down and distract your mind. </h3>
 <h3> ~~ Looking at huge goals can be overwhelming. Instead break down these tasks into jobs that you are capable of completing a day.</h3>
 <h3> ~~If you have trouble waking up super early, try to instead wake up only 10-15 minutes earlier to increase your energy and productivity for the day! </h3>
 <h3> ~~ Even though you might thrive in social media, take a break from it completely for a day, your mind will be reset and easier to understand.</h3>
